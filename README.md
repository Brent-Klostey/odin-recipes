# odin-recipes

This is the first "Project" assigned by TOP where I am creating a website.

This website will contain "Recipes" and will test my basic knowledge of HTML/git/terminal:
- Terminal commands
- Git commands
- Commit message structure/template

HTML specific:
- Boilerplate
- Formatting
- Lists
    - Ordered
    - Unordered
