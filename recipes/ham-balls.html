    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is my newest, favorite meatball recipe. If you like a sweet twist, you'll like this one. The meatballs will be slightly pink inside when done because of the pork, so do not overbake them!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ pounds ground smoked ham</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can tomato soup</li>
        <li>¼ cup cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ham, pork OR sausage, and the ground beef. Stir in the milk, eggs and graham cracker crumbs and mix well. Form into large balls about 2 inches in diameter and place them in a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a separate medium bowl, combine the soup, vinegar, brown sugar and mustard powder. Mix well and pour over the meatballs.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour or until internal meat temperature reaches 160 degrees F (73 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
